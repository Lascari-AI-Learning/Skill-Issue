The idea of handing something off to a computer can be just a little jarring in general. So let's think of this like we're working with a junior engineer you just brought onto the team. If you expect a junior engineer to handle a complex problem, you're just like, \"Here's a task, here's a ticket,\" with a name like \"Update this database table\" or \"Update this service.\" What do you think's going to happen? Do you think the junior engineer is going to be able to go out and like that PR that you're going to get into the codebase is going to be amazing. No, like we're used to handing things off, but when you're working in an organization, there's a lot of standardization. The flow is still the same: you determine what the task should be, you'll scope it out, you then hand it off to your junior engineer, they implement the code, you don't really have control over how they're actually implementing until you see the PR, and then you get feedback and they make the change. But you're not going to set this up in a way where like you just let the engineer figure it out. You have your tests, the commit rules, any company protocols, documentation, GitHub actions, whatever. This is that then you have the junior engineer read before they start really interacting much with core aspects of the codebase. Working with an AI is a lot similar, but it's like you need to figure out how to encode this information so that the AI can at scale and in a wide variety of tasks be able to operate in your codebase in a way where the end goal is that you just give it a scoped-out task and it goes off and does it, and you just have to review the PR and make a few changes.\\\n\\\nAlso for styling, I like the two columns here and the thing on the bottom. But it's like everything in this presentation should have the div box like in the previous slides. It's like a box that's outlined.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}
