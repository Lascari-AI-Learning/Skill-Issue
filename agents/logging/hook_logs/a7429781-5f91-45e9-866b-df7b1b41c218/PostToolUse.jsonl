We've established the problem - 90% adoption, quality tanking, AI amplifying whatever you already have. Now the question becomes: what do we actually DO about it?\n\nThree questions everyone's asking:\n1. HOW - What concrete steps do we take in 2026?\n2. WHAT - What should we be optimizing toward?\n3. WHERE - Where do we allocate our limited time and resources?\n\nThe answer to all three: focus on building TRUST. Trust in AI systems comes from encoding YOUR knowledge into them. It's not about more compute or fancier models - it's about creating systems that reliably produce code you can trust.\n\nTRANSITION: From problem to solution section - let's talk about the mental model first.\n-->\n", "numLines": 54, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 54}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01444XaBT77bZZrP3b1acmb1"}}
