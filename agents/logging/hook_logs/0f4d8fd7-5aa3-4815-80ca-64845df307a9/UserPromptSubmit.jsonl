The idea is more that it's like you know, we don't want to let the bad examples blind you. The technology's coming used to learn it well, and like for skilled engineers, AI is an absolutely huge force multiplier. It's like if you know what you're doing, you will see exponential gains, and it's like start small. The road to 10X is won by you know, incremental improvements, and then we will show the math. I want to adjust the math later, but for now, we'll just show the math. The mentality shift is then like, how can I systematize my knowledge into a skill that best trusts the AI to do properly, and the thing here is it's like bit by bit, we will build AI systems that we trust to actually complete work on our behalf.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

That means it's 20% more affected. So it's like okay, $4,000 to $20,000. That's a 5x ROI, and I think $20,000 is conservative. That would be in the speaker notes."}}
