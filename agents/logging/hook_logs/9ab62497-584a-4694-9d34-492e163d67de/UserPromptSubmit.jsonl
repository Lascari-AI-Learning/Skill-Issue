So the flow that I found myself doing a lot was like okay, why isn't the state loading properly? So I would go in, add some console logs, reload the page, screenshot it, look at the logs, give this to an AI, talk back and forth, and I'm doing a lot of manual processes for this screenshot adding the debug logs and such. So I was like, how could I get an AI to do this? This is where Browser MCP comes in. I can tell the agent, here's how you use this tool, here's how we want to debug it, then execute this workflow where essentially it's like it will add console logs based on where it thinks it should, reload the page, pull in the console logs so that I don't have to copy and paste them, screenshot it so that it has the context, and then we iterate on it together until we are happy. It is also instructed to create logs in a specific format so that when it's done, it could just find all of them and pull them out. So that then we have a working state, but it is not just filled with a bunch of slop comments and console logs. Then, like, kind of lay this out as showing each phase as we already are.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}
