First, it's just a @SKILL.md file, and you add a YAML formatter at the top (like a frontmatter) that just says the name of it and the description of what it does. Simply that. Then you give it some content in the description of the skill, and this, and then you structure it in a folder format. Then you can provide more references, scripts, or whatever, and in the @SKILL.md portion of it, you can say if you need more information, look at these other things for more in-depth information. Then I want to show the XML block - that's like when the agent looks at all your skills and it sees, \"Okay, here is all of these things.\" And then, like, the worked example would be, \"Inputs, process this PDF,\" since that's kind of the skill reference we have here. The agent would be like, \"Oh, I have this skill, let me go read that.\" It would then use a read file head tool to read the description and the begin section, like, \"Okay, this is useful.\" It would then go and find the section, like, \"I need to do this PDF task,\" cool. Let me go read that file. I read it, oh, I see. I need to get this script to do this task, cool. It goes against the script and then now it can actually run the task exactly how you would want it to. For the structure of this slide, I kind of want it to be like how skills work in the top left, and in the top right, there will always be this link that is like, \"Agent skill reference,\" that is then the link to agent skills. We will show different scenes on the same slide, so it's like, in the clicks, you set up to kind of hide and show each click where it's like, \"Okay, here, you know, at click zero, like, nothing's there,\" then the next one shows that next scene, and next, and next. So then it's kind of set up so it's like we stay on one slide, but we can kind of walk through the process.\\\n\\\nSkills reference:\\\n@ai_docs/skills-reference/ \\\n\\\nLink:\\\nhttps://agentskills.io/home\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

In the left, I kind of want to show the code block. The first thing would be like the user input is whatever I need to process this PDF. I want to show the XML formatted system prompt, and then it would be like we have the read command at the bottom. The next thing would be like, \"Okay, the agent would think, 'I have a PDF processing skill. I need to read the skill MD,'\" and then we would show the skill MD file. Then it'd be like, \"I need to read about advanced extraction based off of the user request to extract tables because that's whatever,\" and then it would go read that and see that it needs to run the Python command. So that it would run the Python command, and then like the final quick you could say like resulting in processing exactly how you would want it to.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

Or it's like user input, extract that agent reads the skill, and then um I have the PDF processing, and then essentially we're like you know the right side is kind of the flow, we are the left is showing what the agent currently sees, and then in the bottom is showing the command that the agent runs next. So it's like agent skills, user input says this, we then show what it sees, and it's like \"Okay, the agent then says read skill md\" at the bottom, and the next one would be like showing that skill md and be like \"Okay, I need to\" (the bottom thing would say). Like \"Read advanced processing\", and then it would be like \"Agent sees what it needs to do for advanced processing\" and then it runs the processing script. So essentially it's like the content of the code block and the bottom thing is changing, and the highlighting of which block on the right is changing, but the contents of the right stays the same.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}
