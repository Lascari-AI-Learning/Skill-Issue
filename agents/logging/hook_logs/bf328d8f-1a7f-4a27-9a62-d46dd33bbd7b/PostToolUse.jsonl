This is a **blank slate** presentation being built from scratch.\n\n### Core Thesis (Emerging)\n\nTwitter/social media is full of flashy demos that burn tokens and make impressive-looking changes. But when you step into a **real codebase** - work you get paid for - things break down. The presentation will show:\n1. What \"real value\" actually looks like (Ford's personal stats as proof)\n2. Industry data showing the gap between AI adoption and actual outcomes\n3. The solution: Skills as a way to encode expertise and get consistent, quality results\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n**The gap between AI coding demos and production reality.**\n\nPeople see impressive demos on Twitter - massive token burns, huge diffs, rapid prototypes. But:\n- In real codebases (paid work, teams, production), these approaches break down\n- 90% adoption, but incidents per PR up 23.5%, change failure rate up 30%\n- \"More code, more slop\" - velocity without quality\n- Only 45% have formal AI usage policies - no standardization\n\n## Goals\n\n### High-Level Goals\n\nAudience leaves understanding that **AI amplifies whatever you have** - good foundations = amplified strengths, weak foundations = amplified problems. And that skills/structured approaches are how you encode quality.\n\n### Mid-Level Goals\n\n1. Establish credibility through transparency (Ford's real numbers)\n2. Ground the discussion in industry data (Cortex 2026 report)\n3. Introduce skills as a concrete solution for \"getting it right\"\n4. Walk through a practical example skill\n\n### Detailed Goals\n\n*To be filled in as we discuss specifics...*\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n*What we are explicitly NOT building - prevents scope creep*\n\n- Not a \"Claude Code tutorial\" - assume some familiarity\n- Not comparing AI tools (Copilot vs Cursor vs Claude Code)\n- Not covering MCP in depth (skills reference it but focus stays on skills)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n*How do we know we're done? Testable outcomes*\n\n- [ ] Opening hook lands - audience understands the \"real value vs demo\" distinction\n- [ ] Industry data resonates - they see themselves in the \"more code, more bugs\" paradox\n- [ ] Skills concept clicks - they understand what skills are and why they matter\n- [ ] Actionable takeaway - they know HOW to start applying this\n\n## Context & Background\n\n### Presentation Structure (Emerging)\n\n**Opening Hook:**\n- Ford's personal stats: diff changes, token spend, money made (past 30 days)\n- NOT a flex - it's proof of \"real value\" vs Twitter demos\n- Contrast: You can burn tokens and make changes, but are you creating lines that provide real value?\n\n**Industry Data (Cortex 2026 Benchmark Report):**\n- ~90% of engineering leaders report teams actively using AI tools\n- \"90% adoption, zero standardization\"\n- The Productivity Paradox:\n  - PRs per author +20%\n  - Incidents per PR +23.5%\n  - Change failure rate +30%\n- Key insight: \"AI amplifies both the best and worst aspects of your engineering practices\"\n\n**The Mental Model - Agent as Junior Engineer:**\n- Senior engineer workflow: Create spec/task \u2192 hand to junior \u2192 review PR \u2192 merge\n- You don't hand complex tasks to a brand-new junior (they get chores, minor refactoring)\n- More complex tasks go to the engineer who's been on the project 7 months\n- Goal: Build agents we can hand increasingly complex tasks to\n- Skills are HOW you level up the agent's capability\n\n**The Recipe** (crucial for Claude Code & other agents like Codex, OpenCode):\n1. Modularity\n2. Domain-Driven Design\n3. Painfully explicit specs\n4. Excessive documentation\n\nIf the docs don't clearly answer: **Where, What, How, Why** \u2192 agent guesses \u2192 mess\n\n**The Solution - Skills:**\n- How Ford sets up skills for himself and teams\n- What a skill is structurally (how it's represented in the prompt)\n- Example skill walkthrough\n\n### From Current Notes\n\n- **Occam's Razor**: \"So much of AI is significantly overcomplicated\"\n- **Loop pattern**: \"In loop \u2192 iterate until it works well \u2192 figure out how to step out of loop\"\n- **Frontend debugging example**: Screenshot \u2192 console logs \u2192 add logs \u2192 test \u2192 user feedback loop\n- \"Get this working right instead of just letting the agent rip\"\n- **Separate Concerns**: Research, spec, and plan should be separate (not one mega-prompt)\n- References: Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng, greyhaven-ai/claude-code-config\n\n### Skills Background (from blog post reference)\n\nEvolution: Function Calling \u2192 MCP \u2192 Agent Skills\n- Skills = \"Knowledge & Workflow layer\" - procedural expertise\n- Progressive disclosure - only load context as necessary\n- Best practices: conciseness, appropriate degrees of freedom, frontload info\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n*Capture the WHY behind decisions, not just the WHAT. Include user's reasoning and preferences.*\n\n| Decision | Rationale | Date |\n|----------|-----------|------|\n| Start with personal stats | Credibility through transparency, not bragging - shows \"this is what real value looks like\" | 2025-01-07 |\n| Use Cortex report data | Third-party validation of the \"more code, more bugs\" problem | 2025-01-07 |\n| Frame as \"you already do this with humans\" | Demystifies agents - it's not new, it's the same standardization you do with junior engineers, just formatted for an LLM | 2025-01-07 |\n| Include the \"recipe\" (Modularity, DDD, explicit specs, docs) | This is the \"how\" that bridges problem to solution - without these, agent guesses and makes a mess | 2025-01-07 |\n| Include personal anecdote of bad AI usage | Grounds \"AI amplifies whatever you have\" in real experience - the client project with 5000-line files | 2025-01-07 |\n| End with \"don't let bad examples blind you\" | Crucial reframe - yes the horror stories are real, but for skilled engineers this is a massive opportunity | 2025-01-07 |\n| Push back on \"10x engineer\" myth | Set realistic expectations - it's 10% here, 5% there, compounding over months. No magic pill. | 2025-01-07 |\n| Include concrete ROI math ($10K \u2192 $40K value) | Makes the value prop undeniable - spend $10K in tokens to get $40K in engineering value. No-brainer. | 2025-01-07 |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- [x] What specific aspects of agent skills should the presentation focus on? \u2192 Structure, example skill, \"how Ford sets up his own\"\n- [x] Who is the target audience for this presentation? \u2192 AI meetup attendees (likely devs/engineers interested in AI coding)\n- [ ] What specific example skill do you want to walk through? \u2192 TBD (pin for now)\n- [x] What are your actual numbers for the opening? \u2192 +114,427 lines, ~$864 tokens, $23,480 income\n- [x] How technical should the skill walkthrough be? \u2192 Light touch, 5-7 min, not deep in the weeds\n- [x] What's the \"one thing\" you want them to remember/do after leaving? \u2192 See below\n\n### The One Takeaway\n\nWe're stepping out of the conceptual idea that \"AI won't actually be coming for us\" or \"using AI doesn't actually yield results.\"\n\n**The reality:**\n- AI is becoming truly useful for development tasks BEYOND just MVP projects\n- It can work with real infrastructure IF you put effort into teaching it AND you know what you're doing\n- It doesn't REPLACE your skills - it gives skilled engineers more LEVERAGE\n- It does NOT replace the knowledge you've accrued\n\n### Time Constraints\n\n- ~20 min presentation (including Q&A)\n- Aiming for ~15 min of content\n- Skills section: 5-7 min (light touch, not deep weeds)\n\n## Presentation Outline\n\n```\nThe Skill Issue\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 00-title/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 \"The Skill Issue\"\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Subtitle: \"Agents Decoded in 2026\"\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 QR code for follow-along\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 01-the-problem/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Industry data: 90% adoption, zero standardization (Cortex 2026)\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Link to Cortex report, show key images/stats\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 The Productivity Paradox:\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PRs per author +20%\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Incidents per PR +23.5%\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Change failure rate +30%\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 \"AI amplifies whatever you have\" - I've seen this firsthand:\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Recent client project - had to refactor thousands of lines\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 UI engineer using Cursor without understanding\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Hardcoded strings, 5000+ line files, 20 components per file\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Not his fault - he didn't know what he was doing\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Everyone has seen this: bad engineer + AI = shitstorm to clean up\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 THE MEME (skill-issue.jpg) - the bell curve:\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Left: \"Let AI Write the Code\"\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Middle (crying): \"AI Cannot Match my Skills\"\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Right (enlightened): \"Let AI Write the Code\"\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 BUT: Don't let bad examples blind you to the opportunity\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 For skilled engineers, AI is a HUGE force multiplier\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 02-about-me-and-hook/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Who am I: Ford Lascari - Applied AI Engineer, 3 years GenAI, ~2 years agentic\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Why should you trust me?

Don't generate everything upfront - build detail incrementally with user validation.\n\n### State Tracking\n\nThe `plan_state` in state.json tracks progress for resumability:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plan_state\": {\n    \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n    \"current_checkpoint\": 2,\n    \"current_task_group\": \"2.1\",\n    \"current_task\": \"2.1.1\",\n    \"last_updated\": \"2026-01-01T12:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n### Checkpoints\n\nSequential milestones that incrementally move from current state to target state.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 1,\n  \"title\": \"Implement Core Types\",\n  \"goal\": \"Create foundational data types\",\n  \"prerequisites\": [],\n  \"status\": \"pending\"\n}\n```\n\n### Checkpoint Structuring: Tracer Bullet Approach\n\nStructure checkpoints as **vertical slices** (end-to-end), not horizontal layers. This approach\u2014from \"The Pragmatic Programmer\"\u2014builds a thin, working end-to-end implementation first, then incrementally adds complexity.\n\n**Why Tracer Bullet?**\n- Validates the entire pipeline works before investing heavily\n- Enables testing and verification from checkpoint 1\n- Catches integration issues early, not at the end\n- Each checkpoint produces working, testable code\n\n```\n\u274c AVOID: Layer-by-layer (horizontal slicing)\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502 Checkpoint 1: All data models                       \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 2: All API endpoints                     \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 3: All UI components                     \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 4: Integration testing  \u2190 too late!      \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\n\u2705 PREFER: Tracer bullet (vertical slicing)\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502 Checkpoint 1: One complete flow (model\u2192API\u2192UI)      \u2502\n\u2502               Minimal but WORKING end-to-end        \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 2: Add second flow or enhance first      \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 3: Add complexity to working system      \u2502\n\u2502 Checkpoint 4: Polish, edge cases, refinement        \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n**Key Principle**: After checkpoint 1, you should have something that works end-to-end, even if minimal. Each subsequent checkpoint adds to that working foundation rather than building components in isolation.\n\n**Example - Building a User Export Feature:**\n\n```\n\u274c Horizontal approach:\n  1. Create all export format handlers (CSV, JSON, PDF)\n  2. Build the export API endpoint\n  3. Create the UI export dialog\n  4. Test everything together\n\n\u2705 Tracer bullet approach:\n  1. Export ONE user to CSV (model\u2192service\u2192API\u2192UI\u2192download)\n  2. Add JSON format to working flow\n  3. Add PDF format to working flow\n  4. Add batch export, progress tracking, error handling\n```\n\nThe tracer bullet approach ensures each checkpoint is independently testable and validates assumptions early.\n\n### Task Groups\n\nObjective-based grouping of tasks within a checkpoint.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"1.1\",\n  \"title\": \"Set up data layer\",\n  \"objective\": \"Create foundational data models and repository\",\n  \"status\": \"pending\",\n  \"tasks\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n### Actions\n\nFile-scoped atomic operations within a task. Each action uses IDK format.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"1.1.1.1\",\n  \"command\": \"CREATE TYPE User with fields: id, name, email\",\n  \"file\": \"src/types/user.ts\",\n  \"status\": \"pending\"\n}\n```\n\n### Tasks\n\nUnits of work containing one or more actions. Uses IDK format for precise commands.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"1.1.1\",\n  \"title\": \"Define User type\",\n  \"file_path\": \"src/types/user.ts\",\n  \"context\": { \"read_before\": [...] },\n  \"actions\": [\n    { \"id\": \"1.1.1.1\", \"command\": \"CREATE TYPE User...\", \"file\": \"src/types/user.ts\", \"status\": \"pending\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Self-Contained Task Design\n\n> **Core Principle**: Every task and task group must be executable by an agent in a completely new session with zero prior context.\n\nThe task object itself should contain everything needed to execute it:\n- **File references**: All paths to read, modify, or create\n- **Context**: `read_before` specifies what to understand first\n- **Actions**: Precise IDK commands that are unambiguous\n- **Dependencies**: Explicit `depends_on` if ordering matters\n\n**Why This Matters - Fault Recovery**:\n\nIf execution breaks at Checkpoint 2, Task Group 1, Task 4:\n```\n\u274c Without self-contained tasks:\n   \u2192 Restart entire session\n   \u2192 Re-read all context\n   \u2192 Redo completed work\n\n\u2705 With self-contained tasks:\n   \u2192 Load task 2.1.4 directly\n   \u2192 Task has all file refs and context\n   \u2192 Execute just that task\n   \u2192 Continue from 2.1.5\n```\n\n**Design Test**: Can an agent with only the task object (no session history) execute this task correctly? If yes, the task is properly designed.\n\n```\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n\u2502  SELF-CONTAINED TASK CHECKLIST                                  \u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\n\u2502  \u2713 file_path specifies exact target file                        \u2502\n\u2502  \u2713 read_before lists all files needed for context               \u2502\n\u2502  \u2713 actions use precise IDK commands (no ambiguity)              \u2502\n\u2502  \u2713 description explains WHAT and WHY                            \u2502\n\u2502  \u2713 No implicit knowledge required from prior tasks              \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n## IDK Reference\n\nInformation-Dense Keywords for precise task definitions:\n\n| Category | Keywords | File |\n|----------|----------|------|\n| **CRUD** | CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE | [idk/crud.md](idk/crud.md) |\n| **Actions** | ADD, REMOVE, MOVE, REPLACE, MIRROR, MAKE, USE, APPEND | [idk/actions.md](idk/actions.md) |\n| **Language** | VAR, FUNCTION, CLASS, TYPE, FILE, DEFAULT | [idk/language.md](idk/language.md) |\n| **Location** | BEFORE, AFTER | [idk/location.md](idk/location.md) |\n| **Refactoring** | REFACTOR, RENAME, SPLIT, MERGE, EXTRACT, INLINE, INSERT, WRAP | [idk/refactoring.md](idk/refactoring.md) |\n| **Testing** | TEST, ASSERT, MOCK, VERIFY, CHECK | [idk/testing.md](idk/testing.md) |\n| **Documentation** | COMMENT, DOCSTRING, ANNOTATE | [idk/documentation.md](idk/documentation.md) |\n\n## File Context Tracking\n\nEach checkpoint tracks beginning and ending file states:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"file_context\": {\n    \"beginning\": {\n      \"files\": [{ \"path\": \"...\", \"status\": \"exists\" }],\n      \"tree\": \"ASCII tree visualization\"\n    },\n    \"ending\": {\n      \"files\": [{ \"path\": \"...\", \"status\": \"new\" }],\n      \"tree\": \"ASCII tree visualization\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nEach checkpoint includes verification approach:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"testing_strategy\": {\n    \"approach\": \"Type checking and unit tests\",\n    \"verification_steps\": [\n      \"Run tsc --noEmit\",\n      \"Run jest src/types/__tests__\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `/session:plan [session-id]` | Start/resume planning |\n| `/session:plan [session-id] finalize` | Finalize plan for build |\n\n## Outputs\n\n- `plan.json` - Structured plan (source of truth)\n- `plan.md` - Human-readable plan (generated)\n- `state.json` - Updated with `plan_state`\n\n## Templates\n\n- [plan.json](templates/plan.json) - Plan structure template\n\n## Reference\n\n- [models.py](reference/models.py) - Pydantic models for type-safe plan structure\n\n## Scripts\n\n- [sync-plan-md.py](scripts/sync-plan-md.py) - Auto-generates plan.md from plan.json (triggered via PostToolUse hook)\n", "numLines": 298, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 298}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01GFWJTBhJhzDjt3agj8y8wp"}}

We're not here to sell another AI tool - we're here to have an honest engineering conversation about where Claude Code fits in your toolkit.\n\nThe three pillars:\n\n1. **Holistic View**: We'll explore what Claude Code really is - not the marketing pitch, but the engineering reality. How it fits into the broader ecosystem of AI tools and why it takes a fundamentally different approach.\n\n2. **The Differentiator**: Most AI coding tools force you to choose between speed and control. We'll see how Claude Code found a sweet spot that respects your expertise while amplifying your productivity.\n\n3. **Is It For You?**: Let's be honest - Claude Code isn't for everyone. It's designed for engineers who ship production code and need tools that work at that level of complexity and reliability.\n-->", "numLines": 85, "startLine": 1, "totalLines": 85}}, "tool_use_id": "toolu_01GFummRSs158BRZpM3yCjmT"}}
