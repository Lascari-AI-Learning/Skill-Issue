So I removed them. Please just reread and understand that this is a blank slate. I also added some current notes and such into the context along with a PDF report. Generally, we use this as a talk at an AI meetup, and the thing I'm trying to talk about is AI and Agentic coding in 2026 and what I'm focusing on. The general opening is I'm going to show the number of lines I've made or, you know, the diff changes I've made in the past 30 days, the amount of token spend I've had on Claude Code, and how much money I have made in the past 30 days. This is to show not like a flex on like, \"Oh my God! Look, I'm making all this money,\" but the idea is more that on Twitter and other platforms you will see a lot of people be like, \"Look how crazy this new technique is or whatever.\" And yes, you can burn a lot of tokens. You can make a bunch of changes to a codebase but then when you start to step into a real codebase that you need, i.e. things you'd get paid to do for your company or whether you're an independent developer or you have a team of developers and such things start to break down and there aren't as many examples of what you really are creating lines that provide real value with these AI tools rather than just showing some flashy demo. This is then to kind of cement that. From this benchmark report PDF, there are a couple of slides. One that there is, you know, everyone seemed to say that the report says nearly 90% of engineering leaders report that their team is actively using these AI tools and this is ranging quite a bit from what they actually do. I'll include a screenshot of this slide along with. But in that, there is like very little standardization along with this. A big thing people see is that there is yes, there is a lot more code being committed but also PR failure rates increased by about the same amount of PR content that is coming out so it's like while you are creating more code, you are creating a lot of extra slop. Then I'm going to kind of go into the way of like how I set up my own skills and such for how you write code and stuff for yourself and for your team is very important. Go over generally what a skill is and how they are structured generally and then kind of walk through an example skill that has given me a lot of usefulness.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

And it's like, the idea is that we are trying to make agents more reliable, to be able to actually hand off tasks in a similar way to where if you are a senior engineer, you will create a spec and a task and stuff. Hand that to a junior engineer. You're not doing the implementation. You then just kind of review the pull request, make sure things look good, make sure tests pass, whatever this may be. And then you bring that into the codebase. But this is where we have kind of an issue is that a lot of tasks you can't really pass off to agents or you wouldn't trust them to be able to pass off in a way where it's similar early, you wouldn't pass off. There are different tasks like complexities that you would pass off to different junior engineers, so that is still onboarding. You would not pass that off a more complex task to them. You know, you may pass off like let's say like a chore or minor refactoring or something like that. That's like just getting your feet wet. But if you're actually like, \"Okay, we need to add this new feature,\" here you go. Then you'd wanna pass up to the engineer that may still be not a senior engineer but has been working on the project for let's say like seven months or something. And then the idea is that we are trying to build agents that we can kind of make more and more complex tasks feasible and like a good way to do that is then through skills and then we would start talking about what skills are, how they're represented in the prompt and then kind of like what the general structure of one and part of the idea that I'm trying to get at here is the following.\\\n\\\nFor Claude Code & other agents\nCodex, OpenCode, etc\n\nThere\u2019s a crucial recipe:\n\n1.

Like you would just hand off a task to let something else do it completely and you have no control other than like the code review and such?\" But this is what every engineering team does when they work with other engineers. There is some engineer less skilled than you are in your certain codebase that you then determine like generally what the task should be and you give it to them and then you can't review it but how it gets done and everything you don't have but there is this implied or explicit way of doing things that standardizes the process of working with them whether that's like compact rules on Git commits to then pass tests you know GitHub actions whatever form of standardization that makes sure things get in there different companies have to then kind of keep things in line. The idea here is that we are trying to transition whatever that you or your company has in terms of standardization protocols into something that can be given to an LLM and acted upon without your effort in the same way any documentation you would have some on a new junior engineer reads they understand what standards that you put forward for them to contribute to the projects that you're working on."}}

Skills are essentially just an opinionated way of formatting various Markdown files that allow for the agent to self-discover processes and such within the skill for allowing it to then pick up knowledge as it needs to go depending on the task that it's given. It can be a little bit confusing. For this, where Anthropic recently just put this out, and it's been adopted as the general skill structure and whatnot. But it is not that complicated for setting up. The flow would then be:\n1. Generally, you'd have a skill that has these top-level who would then show from the blog post and the images that you can find for Anthropic and whatnot.\n2. Here is generally how it goes into the prompt.\n3. The model can see I have any of these skills in the system, probably be like acquire any skills that you need to before they happen, and it then will go and read these files, and thus you know air quotes it has acquired this skill because it has read this file with this specific knowledge, and that is now within the context window for the agent to operate for the rest of the task.\n4. Then we'd go into kind of the skill structure of the file where it's like you know an how this would work.\n5. It's like here's the file tree, here are then like you know the references and whatnot.\n6. From the main skill, you'd be like for this type of workflow, go to this file, so if it's like okay, I need this skill, okay, I need this specific portion of the skill that reads that, and then now it has you know knows how to do this.\n7. This is from a idea of progressive disclosure where only load context when it's needed from various places.\\\n\\\nThen the recipe portion would be like what we are trying to do with the skills. It's encoding whatever engineering knowledge that you or your team has in the way that you do things into these skills. So that then whenever you queue up an agent, it can first just more efficiently do flows that you already do. But eventually you trust the agent enough that then you can queue it as a background task. And then all you need to do is review the system and make sure things are right, and you know, stepping farther and farther out of the loop. So that then eventually a lot of tasks that you do in your codebase are performed almost completely by agents."}}

But in a recent client project I worked on, I ended up having to go and do a lot of front-end work. I was reading through the code that the main engineer on the front-end had written, and I talked to him, and he had just been using Cursor to generate it, but it was god-awful, and I had to do thousands of lines of refactoring because he had just hardcoded strings and stuff in the demo, so every file he had touched was like a minimum of 5,000 lines long. We had 20 different components in one file, separated by comment blocks. It was just horrendous, and it's not his fault because he was more of a UI engineer that had to write front-end code and he didn't really know what he was doing. But I think this is what everyone has seen: They see the guy or the examples of people that don't know what they're doing use AI, and then it just creates a shitstorm that they have to clean up. People call that coding, but I'm trying to say is don't let this one bad example block your mind from the fact that this is coming and skilled engineers that if you understand what you're doing, AI is a huge force multiplier for yourself.\\\n\\\nThis also, I think, should be included in the key takeaway.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

Like being 10 times as much output is a good goal to strive for, but in reality, that's not what you're going to have. It's like aiming for little bits here and there that make you just 10% faster, 5% faster, but these compound over time. You find these little speed-ups in your workflow compounding over months of this, and you will get there, but it's not like there is some magic pill that is instantly going to make you 10 times more powerful. It's like AI does not replace knowledge. We can encode skills and stuff into the Flow that then make the agents able to replicate your work much more efficiently, but this doesn't mean to you know just let the AI handle it completely yet. But it's like you're trying to build towards that future.\\\n\\\nLike in the closing or somewhere in there too. It's like if you have a team of 10 developers and you get them using AI effectively, where then on average they are 40% more effective. That is a huge amount of output increase. If you can get your current team to be essentially have 4 more engineers on them for the same price or for the price of tokens which are extraordinarily cheap in comparison to the salary of a skilled engineer, and that is kind of the mentality that you should be taking. What are things that we can systematize and add into these agent skill sets that then allow us to whoever is like the best on the team of one thing to transfer those skills effectively to the rest of them to increase the overall output of an organization. Or if it's a singular person like myself, this then allows you to handle more projects which then can increase more revenue and so forth.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

If I could say one thing to kind of do, or one takeaway, it's that we are starting to step out of this conceptual idea that \"AI won't actually be coming for us\" or that \"using AI doesn't actually yield results\". It's starting to become truly useful for development tasks beyond just MVP projects. It is actually able to work with real infrastructure and stuff, given that you put the effort into teaching it and that you know what you're doing.
