After skills work, the next thing should be clear - what skills do I need?\n2. It's cool to see all these people with crazy different things, but it's like, what do I need?\n3. I want to then show my co-founder, director be like, \"You can have a lot\" and this I know can seem daunting, but it's like, first you figure out what you need to do, and then you make a skill and you iterate on it with you in the loop, and then you pass it out.\n4. The example skill will then be the next slide. I knew it's going to be just put a placeholder now, but it is for a front-end debugging workflow.\\\n\\\nultrathink\\\n\\\nplease use styling like in @slides/08-how-skills-work.md "}}

Like, I like the fact that everyone has different workflows. I want to then show here it's like you know to show my directory then and just be like I have a lot, but it's like during this presentation I was like \"What do I show?\" Because I'm like my workflow is likely not the same as a lot of you other people, and there is not like everyone is different or what is useful for yourself or your team. But then it's just but it and then it's like the general rules are then like you know the iterate figure things out and they just iterate on it and then eventually you can figure out a way to pass it off to an agent, and that's kind of like the three blocks that should be in there. So, this essentially like to summarize it, it would be like the path forward would first be centered on \"What skills do I need?\" It's like where the path forward will be removed, it's like \"What skills do I need?\" centered, and it's like the first show everyone has different workflows, then show my skills, and then we're going to go into like the \"Find your repeated workflows\" or like the process which is you know figure out what you need, make the skill iterate with you in the loop, refine it, and then you know pass it out or try to fully automate it.\\\n\\\nultrathink"}}

Then functions like it's like three columns:\n1. Figure out what you need\n2. What I do repeatedly\n3. What takes too long  Let's do only I have that stuff. Make the skill and then iterate on it. This is key because you need to make sure it actually does what you want it to do and then you pass it out or automate it. If you are in a team, you could share it or you can try to step out of the loop entirely. This should use the three-column layout. I believe this is the intro. What will cover layout in the template slides."}}
