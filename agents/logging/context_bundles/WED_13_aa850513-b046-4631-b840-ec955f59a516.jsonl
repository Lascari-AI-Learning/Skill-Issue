A lot of people, when they go about making skills and sub-agents, give everything to the agent just right out the go, and it's like this leads to bad skills and such because the flow you haven't tested you're not based on your actual flow and iterating with it until you're like I'm very happy with how this works, I'm in it now, how can I take myself out of it, and trying to make it as simple as possible without add"}
