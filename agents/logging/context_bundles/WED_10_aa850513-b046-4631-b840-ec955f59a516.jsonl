Hand that to a junior engineer. You're not doing the implementation. You then just kind of review the pull request, make sure things look good, make sure tests pass, whatever this may be. And then "}

We structure it as like a file tree, so it's like Slide 1 - Intro, and then instead of like actual files, there would be like some sentences or something. Then it's kind of like we just break it down like that so I can kind of see what the flow is that we're going for."}

I think the framing of the mental model would be like... And this isn't like you do - I think something gets lost when people start talking about agents in the sense that it's like: \"Oh! Like you would just hand off a task to let something else do it completely and you have no control other than like the code review and such?\" But this is what every engineering team does when th"}

Skills are essentially just an opinionated way of formatting various Markdown files that allow for the agent to self-discover processes and such within the skill for allowing it to then pick up knowledge as it needs to go depending on the task that it's given. It can be a little bit confusing. For this, where Anthropic recently just put this out, and it's been adopted as the general skill structure and w"}
