The idea is more that it's like you know, we don't want to let the bad examples blind you. The technology's coming used to learn it well, and like for skilled engineers, AI is an absolutely huge force multiplier. It's like if you know what you're doing, you will see exponential gains, and it's like start small. The road to 10X is won by you know, incremental improvements, and th"}

{"operation": "prompt", "prompt": "No, like everything should have a card in the background. Look at the hook where it's like everything has this car that separates it with the background. I'm fine with one side only having a thicker border and no things, but I want it to have a card behind it that's white, which then kind of makes the text pop."}

{"operation": "prompt", "prompt": "Can we adjust this to be like the token spend per engineer? Then it will do 20% more effective. This thing would be token spend per engineer, let's just say $400 for 10 engineers. That's $4,000 a month. The average engineer cost is let's say $10,000 a month. That means it's 20% more affected. So it's like okay, $4,000 to $20,000. That's a 5x ROI, and I think $20,000 is conservative. That would be in the speaker notes."}
