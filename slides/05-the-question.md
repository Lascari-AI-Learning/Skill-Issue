SPEAKER NOTES (Pivot Point - ~3 min mark):

This is the pivot point. We've established the problem - 90% adoption, quality tanking, AI amplifying whatever you already have. Now the question becomes: what do we actually DO about it?

Three questions everyone's asking:
1. HOW - What concrete steps do we take in 2026?
2. WHAT - What should we be optimizing toward?
3. WHERE - Where do we allocate our limited time and resources?

The answer to all three: focus on building TRUST. Trust in AI systems comes from encoding YOUR knowledge into them. It's not about more compute or fancier models - it's about creating systems that reliably produce code you can trust.

TRANSITION: From problem to solution section - let's talk about the mental model first.
