SPEAKER NOTES (Pivot Point - ~3 min mark):

This is the pivot point. We've established the problem - 90% adoption, quality tanking, AI amplifying whatever you already have. Now the question becomes: what do we actually DO about it? How do you move from "AI writes bad code" to "AI writes code I can trust"? The answer isn't more compute or fancier models - it's about encoding YOUR knowledge. Let's talk about the mental model first.

TRANSITION: From problem to solution section.
