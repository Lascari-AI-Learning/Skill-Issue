Here are the key takeaways. First, don't let bad examples blind you. Yes, there are people making a mess with AI coding tools - but this technology is coming whether you like it or not. Learn to use it well.

For skilled engineers - people who know what good code looks like - AI is a HUGE force multiplier. You're the ones who benefit most because you can steer it effectively.

Let's do the math. Each engineer using about $1,000/month in tokens. 10 engineers = $10K spend. An average engineer costs about $10K/month. If your team is 40% more effective, that's $40K in value. You're spending $10K to get $40K. That's 4x ROI. This is a no-brainer investment.

The mentality shift is asking: "What can we systematize into skills?" Take the best practices from your top performers and transfer them to the whole team through skills. That's how you scale quality.
