SPEAKER NOTES:

Don't let the bad examples blind you. Yes, there are people making a mess with AI coding tools, but this technology is coming whether you like it or not. Learn to use it well.

For skilled engineers - people who know what good code looks like - AI is a HUGE force multiplier. If you know what you're doing, you'll see exponential gains.

But start small. The road to 10x isn't one giant leap - it's won by incremental improvements. 10% faster here, 5% faster there. These compound over months.

Let's look at the math. Each engineer using about $400/month in tokens. 10 engineers = $4K spend. An average engineer costs about $10K/month. If your team is just 20% more effective, that's $20K in value - and $20K is conservative. Spend $4K to get $20K - that's 5x ROI.

The mentality shift is asking: "How can I systematize my knowledge into a skill that I trust the AI to do properly?" Bit by bit, we build AI systems we trust to actually complete work on our behalf. That's the future we're building toward.
