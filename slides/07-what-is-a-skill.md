<!--
So what IS a skill? It's an opinionated way of formatting Markdown files that allows AI agents to self-discover processes. Think of it like documentation that the AI can actually use. Anthropic recently released this as a standard structure in Claude Code, and it's becoming the de facto way to encode engineering knowledge for AI. The good news? It's not complicated to set up - if you've ever written documentation for a new hire, you've already done 80% of the work.
