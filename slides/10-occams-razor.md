<!--
The biggest mistake people make with skills is trying to hand everything to the agent right out of the gate. They dump a whole workflow and expect magic. The result? Bad skills. The flow isn't tested, and it's not based on YOUR actual working process.

The right approach is Occam's Razor style. First, work IN the loop - do the work alongside the agent manually. Iterate until you're happy with how it flows. THEN ask yourself: "How can I take myself out of this?" That's when you codify it into a skill.

Keep it as simple as possible. Don't add complexity until you need it. Start small, validate it works, then expand.
